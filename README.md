# Zapper Android Developer Assessment

Hi there! below is my assessment overview

# Requirements
- Use Java (not Kotlin)
- Create an app that only allows portrait mode.
- Create one activity and have a fragment (ListFragment) inside that containing a recycler view and a "refresh" button.
- Using one of the following libraries (volley, retrofit, okhttp), download and display the results, of the API you chose, in the recycler view.
- Use a background job to call the api and return the results to the UIThread (in the list fragment).
- Make the minimum android version api level 21.
- Add a fragment (DetailFragment) that displays the selected item from the recycler view in this fragment.
- Add a search field to the ListFragment to filter the results locally. Avoid locking up the UIThread.
- Add a theme and styling of your own choosing.
- Please also test the android lifecycle. Pausing and resuming the app.
- Only call the endpoint if the list is refreshed or when the app is launched the first time.

### Tech stack Used
- Programming Language : Java

> You can complete these tasks in any order you like, but starting with one or two bugs might be a good way to get into the codebase.
